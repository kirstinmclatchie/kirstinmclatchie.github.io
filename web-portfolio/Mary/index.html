			<h2>The<br>Journey</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="poem-one">
			<p>One day you finally knew<br>
			what you had to do, and began,<br>
			though the voices around you<br>
			kept shouting<br>
			their bad advice--<br>
			though the whole house<br>
			began to tremble<br>
			and you felt the old tug<br>
			at your ankles.<br>
			"Mend my life!"<br>
			each voice cried.<br>
			But you didn't stop.<br>
			You knew what you had to do,<br>
			though the wind pried<br>
			with its stiff fingers<br>
			at the very foundations,<br>
			though their melancholy<br>
			was terrible.<br>
			It was already late<br>
			enough, and a wild night,<br>
			and the road full of fallen<br>
			branches and stones.<br>
			But little by little,<br>
			as you left their voices behind,<br>
			the stars began to burn<br>
			through the sheets of clouds,<br>
			and there was a new voice<br>
			which you slowly<br>
			recognized as your own,<br>
			that kept you company<br>
			as you strode deeper and deeper<br>
			into the world,<br>
			determined to do<br>
			the only thing you could do--<br>
			determined to save<br>
			the only life you could save.</p>

			<h2>Wild Geese</h2>
			<div class="poem-two">
				<p>You do not have to be good.<br>
				You do not have to walk on your knees<br>
				for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.<br>
				You only have to let the soft animal of your body<br>
				love what it loves.<br>
				Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.<br>
				Meanwhile the world goes on.<br>
				Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain<br>
				are moving across the landscapes, <br>
				over the prairies and the deep trees,<br>
				the mountains and the rivers.<br>
				Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,<br>
				are heading home again.<br>
				Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,<br>
				the world offers itself to your imagination,<br>
				calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting<br>
				over and over announcing your place <br>
				in the family of things.</p>

			<div class="verse">
				<p>On a summer morning<br>
				I sat down<br>
				on a hillside<br>
				to think about God -</p>
			</div>
			<div class="verse">
				<p>a worthy pastime.<br>
				Near me, I saw<br>
				a single cricket;<br>
				it was moving the grains of the hillside</p>

				<p>this way and that way.<br>
				How great was its energy,<br>
				how humble its effort.<br>
				Let us hope</p>

				<p>it will always be like this,<br>
				each of us going on<br>
				in our inexplicable ways<br>
				building the universe.</p>

				<h2>Bone</h2>
			</div>
				<h3>1.</h3>
				<p>Understand, I am always trying to figure out<br>
				what the soul is,<br>
				and where hidden,<br>
				and what shape <br>
				and so, last week,<br>
				when I found on the beach<br>
				the ear bone<br>
				of a pilot whale that may have died<br>
				hundreds of years ago, I thought<br>
				maybe I was close<br>
				to discovering something <br>
				for the ear bone</p>
				<h3>2.</h3>
				<p>
				is the portion that lasts longest<br>
				in any of us, man or whale; shaped<br>
				like a squat spoon<br>
				with a pink scoop where<br>
				once, in the lively swimmer's head,<br>
				it joined its two sisters<br>
				in the house of hearing,<br>
				it was only<br>
				two inches long<br> 
				and thought: the soul<br>
				might be like this <br>
				so hard, so necessary </p>
				<h3>3.</h3>
				<p>yet almost nothing.<br>
				Beside me<br>
				the gray sea<br>
				was opening and shutting its wave-doors,
				unfolding over and over<br>
				its time-ridiculing roar;<br>
				I looked but I couldn't see anything<br>
				through its dark-knit glare;<br>
				yet don't we all know, the golden sand<br>
				is there at the bottom,<br>
				though our eyes have never seen it,<br>
				nor can our hands ever catch it</p>
				<h3>4.</h3>
				<p>lest we would sift it down<br>
				into fractions, and facts<br>
				certainties<br>
				and what the soul is, also<br>
				I believe I will never quite know.<br>
				Though I play at the edges of knowing,<br>
				truly I know<br>
				our part is not knowing,<br>
				but looking, and touching, and loving,<br>
				which is the way I walked on,<br>
				softly,<br>
				through the pale-pink morning light.</p>

			<h3>About Mary Oliver</h3>
			<p>A private person by nature, Mary Oliver has given very few interviews over the years. Instead, she prefers to let her work speak for itself. And speak it has, for the past five decades, to countless readers. Born in a small town in Ohio, Oliver published her first book of poetry in 1963 at the age of 28.</p>
